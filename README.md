## Functionality/Features

Home screen contains a list of films pulled from the SWAPI

List should be searchable

Films can be favourited, this state should be persisted using local storage

Favourited films should appear at the top of the list

A stylised user prompt/alert should show when a film is favourited

Favourited films can be unfavourited

Film list items can be clicked to show individual film page

Film page should show all the information pulled from the SWAPI endpoint for an individual film

Film page should contain a back to home link

The list of characters should display a tooltip when a list item is hovered

The tooltip should show the character's bio pulled from the SWAPI endpoint for people

Provide public GitHub repo to source code

Host the finished project on Heroku, Surge or similar

This test is focused on demonstrating Ruby on Rails, do not sweat the styling too much and feel free to use a framework like Bootstrap or similar

Use the tooltip UI to show additional information pertaining to the film like vehicles, spaceships etc

Demonstrate creative and performant ways of fetching information from SWAPI

Provide a documented readme inside the GitHub repo explaining the technology used, the setup process and other relevant information
